We can do it quite easily with the `matplotlib` and `numpy` libraries. We create a `numpy` array of the same size as the grid, filled with zeros. Then we use the `coord_iter` method in the `grid` object, which lets us loop over every cell in the grid, giving us each cell’s coordinates and contents in turn."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"A1XjIrWYxgEN","outputId":"d56cfe69-2ed2-4eec-ef02-d653cd792b41"},"outputs":[{"data":{"image/png":"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
